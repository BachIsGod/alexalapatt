I found Dreams of Glory by William Steig and decided to buy it for three reasons:

1) The book was 60 years old and in good condition
2) The book has "Property of The New Yorker" stamped on a few pages
3) It was not available on Amazon (at the time) for < $50.00

The book is a small large collection of drawings that were part of the book "Small Fry" or pictured in the New Yorker.

While I didn't get the humor of some of the drawings, they definitely must have caused a stir in the 50's or even now.

I went on to read about William and found out that he wrote the book that was the foundation for Shrek.
