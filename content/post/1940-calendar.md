The average price for a 2021 calendar right now is $10 on Amazon. They are beautiful calendars that come with a beautiful picture each month. There are many choices, such as Ansel Adam pictures, weekly Dilbert or National Geographic. Each month or week you will get a new picture to review and then a monthly list of dates.

Contrast that to a 1946 Calendar made by the Friedler Calendar Company in New Haven Connecticut. Instead of a minimum of 12 pictures, you get one picture of a landscape labeled "Green Pastures. The artist is not identified, but a picture search shows it was drawn by Thomas Moran, of the Hudson School.

I happen to have a 2021 calendar, so I wanted to check two points on this 1946 Calendar: 1) What are the differences in historical milestones between 1946 and 2021 and 2) Did the 1946 Calendar get any entries wrong.

Given that I was listing differences, I started judging the two calendars. Which was better than the other based on the milestones listed? The 2021 edition felt much more cosmopolitan, but the 1946 dates had some feel-good American dates. I scanned the dates again and I really don't have a winner; I ideally would like to combine the milestones to get a list of events in our multi-cultural society while also listing some important dates.

One interesting point about the dates is the December 1946 Milestone for Capt. Colin P. Kelly, Jr. Sank the Haruna. I never heard about that event, so I read through a Wikipedia entry. Surprisingly, the event appears to be wrong:

*On 13 December 1941, an erroneous report was published in the U.S. media that an American B-17 heavy bomber had bombed and mortally damaged Haruna during battle off Lingayen Gulf off the Philippines. No Japanese battleships were present, and Haruna was 1,500 nmi (2,800 km; 1,700 mi) away in the Gulf of Siam at the time.[21]*

Thus even though this calendar was published five years after the event, the calendar writer still got the details wrong.
