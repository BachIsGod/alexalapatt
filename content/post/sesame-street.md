Whitney Cummings tweeted this once:

*I’m shopping for my niece and nephew and I’m having trouble finding things for him that don’t glorify killing and carnage and things and for her that don’t encourage wearing make up and being a mom at five years old. Help? Suggestions?*— Whitney Cummings (@WhitneyCummings) December 22, 2018

Too bad she couldn't get on eBay fast enough to get this Giant Snuffleupagus floor puzzle!

The toy pictures two women and two boys playing with the toy. Two of the kids are white and two are black. There is nothing in the picture that glorifies "carnage" or wearing makeup as a child. You can't even see the kids faces as they are too busy putting together the puzzle.

After staring at the picture for a few minutes, I put the puzzle together and I had a great time all by myself.

I'm surprised that the recommended age range is 3-6. I'm 37 and I had a blast putting it together. The age range should be 3-99 like most toys these days. The puzzle states there are only 14 pieces, but I counted 15 and I used all of them! This toy was made in 1973, so maybe they didn't pay that much attention to what went into the description.

So Whitney, if you are looking for a gender generic toy, try getting the giant snuffleupagus floor puzzle.
